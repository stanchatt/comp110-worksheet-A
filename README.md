Second, upload your SpaceChem save file to be analysed by the automatic marking script:
* Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, using the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
* Locate your SpaceChem save file on your hard disk. Normally it is stored under `C:\Users\<your name>\AppData\Local\Zachtronics Industries\SpaceChem\save\000.user`.
